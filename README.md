## **Inspiration**
In a world bursting with movie options, we wanted to create something that helps people find what they really want to watch. With the power of **semantic search**, **MovieSeek** lets users find and discover films through natural language queries, making it way easier to connect with their next favourite film.

## **What it Does**
So, what can you do with **MovieSeek**? Here’s a taste:
- Search movie datasets using plain, natural language.
- Dive into movie data like ratings, genres, and reviews, all at your fingertips!

We kicked things off by using **Netflix/IMDB datasets** to show off our semantic search capabilities, laying the groundwork for a slick movie exploration tool.

## **How We Built It**
Here’s how we brought **MovieSeek** to life:
- **Front-end**: Built with **Streamlit** to keep things simple and user-friendly.
- **Back-end**: Our trusty **Python** code handles everything from data retrieval to semantic search magic.
- **Data**: We played around with **Netflix/IMDB datasets** to test our semantic search and dive deep into movie analysis.

We kept our collaboration smooth with **Codespaces**, allowing us to code and communicate in real-time.

## **Challenges We Faced**
Like any project, we ran into a few bumps along the way:
- **Team Organisation**: At first, we struggled with time management and keeping everyone on the same page.
- **Tech Stack**: As newbies to semantic search, we had to learn fast and adapt our approach.
- **External Issues**: We lost a bit of time due to outside factors, but attending a workshop on **RAG AI (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** reignited our motivation and provided some fantastic strategies to boost our semantic search capabilities.
- **Time Crunch**: Juggling data integration and front-end development under tight deadlines was definitely a challenge!

## **What We're Proud Of**
Despite the challenges, we achieved some cool milestones:
- We successfully implemented **semantic search** using **Netflix and IMDB datasets**.
- Created a **Streamlit-based front end** that’s easy to use and shows off our work nicely.
- Overcame initial setbacks to deliver a functional project right on time.
- Fostered a fantastic collaborative spirit across our diverse team.

## **What We Learned**
This journey has been a real learning experience for us:
- We discovered how to effectively integrate **semantic search** with various datasets while keeping the user experience front and centre.
- Improved our **Streamlit** skills, making it easier to whip up effective front ends quickly.
- Gained hands-on experience in project management and learned how to develop rapidly under pressure.
- The insights from the **RAG AI** workshop taught us practical strategies to refine our search algorithms and enhance user interaction.

## **What’s Next**
We’re excited about the future! Here’s what’s on our radar:
- Expanding our dataset to include even more movie data, focusing on user preferences and trends.
- Enhancing the **semantic search algorithms** for more nuanced and specific movie-related queries.
- Broaden the front-end functionalities, moving towards a dynamic **full-stack web application**.
- Adding **data visualisation tools** to help users interpret search results and glean deeper insights.

## **Tech Stack**
Here’s what we used to build this project:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (if applicable)
- **Tools**: GitHub, Codespaces, Jupyter Notebooks
