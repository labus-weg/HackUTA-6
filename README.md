## **Inspiration**
We wanted to create a meaningful application that aligns with **October's Cancer Awareness Month**, leveraging the power of **semantic search** to help users explore cancer-related datasets easily. This project aims to provide a helpful tool for users and professionals who wish to search and understand complex healthcare data.

## **What it Does**
**SemanticCare** allows users to:
- Search cancer datasets using **natural language queries**.
- Explore cancer data and retrieve relevant information quickly.
  
Our initial demo uses **Netflix/IMDB datasets** for semantic search testing, and the ultimate goal is to switch to healthcare-specific datasets, starting with **cancer**.

## **How We Built It**
- **Front-end**: Built using **Streamlit**, which provides a simple user interface.
- **Back-end**: **Python** code handling data retrieval and semantic search functionality.
- **Data**: Used **Netflix/IMDB datasets** for semantic search testing and **cancer datasets** to visualize and explore medical information.
  
We used **Codespaces** to streamline the coding process and ensure real-time collaboration.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**
- **Team Organization**: Faced initial difficulties with time management and team coordination.
- **Tech Stack**: As first-time users of semantic search, we had to quickly learn and adapt.
- **External Issues**: Lost hours due to external factors, but regained motivation after attending a workshop on **RAG AI (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.
- **Time Crunch**: We faced challenges balancing the integration of data and frontend building with very limited time.

## **Accomplishments We're Proud Of**
- Successfully implemented **semantic search** using **Netflix datasets**.
- **Streamlit-based frontend** for ease of use and demonstration.
- Overcame initial setbacks to deliver a functional project on time.
- Fostered collaboration across different academic levels, with contributions from undergraduate and graduate students.

## **What We Learned**
- Learned how to integrate **semantic search** with diverse datasets and make it **user-friendly**.
- Improved our skills with **Streamlit**, enhancing our ability to build simple frontends quickly.
- Gained valuable experience in project management and rapid development under time pressure.

## **What's Next**
- Transition fully to **healthcare datasets**, focusing on enhancing the **cancer dataset** for medical use.
- Improve the **semantic search algorithms** to handle more specific medical queries.
- Expand the frontend functionality, moving towards a more dynamic **full-stack web application**.
- Implement **data visualization tools** for easier interpretation of search results.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (if applicable)
- **Tools**: GitHub, Codespaces, Jupyter Notebooks

## **Installation Instructions**
